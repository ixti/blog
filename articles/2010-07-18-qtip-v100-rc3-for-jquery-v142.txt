If you are using <a href="http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/">qTip plug-in</a> for <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and have updated your jQuery to version 1.4.2, you might notice that qTip become broken. That's because of jQuery's change in logic of <code>jQuery.data(el, key, data)</code> function. Before version v.1.4.2 it returned <code>undefined</code> upon requesting undefined data, and now it returns <code>null</code>, so <code>typeof $(this).data('qtip') == 'undefined'</code> check in the qTip fails, as <code>null</code> is <em>object</em>...

In order to avoid this (and make qTip v.1.0.0-rc3 compatible with jQuery v.1.4.2) I have extended such conditions with something like <code>null === $(this).data('qtip')</code> just to keep close to the original, but become v.1.4.2 compatible :))

I have already sent patch to Craig Thompson (author of qTip), so proably when he'll have some time he will apply it and upload new version of qTip on it's official homepage. But before it will (or will not) happen, you can grab your very own copy of patch (or simply patched version) from here.

<ins datetime="2010-07-28T16:01:18+00:00">UPDATE:</ins> Seems like next release of jQuery will bring "broken" parts fixed again. The problem with v.1.4.2 was because of <code>$.data()</code> function returned <code>null</code> upon undefined value instead of <code>undefined</code> as previous releases. And right now in the trunk it's code was fixed, so it returns <code>undefined</code> again :)) So instead of using this patch you can simply update your jQuery to the bleeding edge ;))

<ins datetime="2010-10-30T11:10:56+00:00">UPDATE:</ins> jQuery v.1.4.3 was released on 14th October 2010, so now I guess you can simply update jQuery to fix a bug without modifying qTip.
