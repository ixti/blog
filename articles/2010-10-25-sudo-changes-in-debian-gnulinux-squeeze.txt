If you have recently upgraded your (or dist-upgraded to) "squeeze", you might noticed that <code>sudo</code> now works a little bit strange. It asks for a password too often. Some people even thought it asks a password every-time now. That's incorrect. Timeout was left same as it was before. But <code>tty_ticket</code> become <code>on</code> by default...

To be honest, this is not related to Debian GNU/Linux at all. This change was made by Todd C. Miller (author of <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/">sudo</a>) on 2010-07-20, commit <a href="http://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/73dd2b82a3a9">73dd2b82a3a9</a>. So now <code>tty_ticket</code> is on by default. That means that users must authenticate on a per-tty basis. In other words, calling <code>sudo true</code> twice on the same tty (or pts) will ask for a password only once. But it will ask again (regardless to the timeout) on another tty.

In fact this is a great thing about sudo. But if you want to change default behavior (to disable tty_ticket by default), you can simply put this line into your <code>sudoers</code> file:

```
Defaults !tty_tickets
```

That's all. But think twice before disabling it by default.
