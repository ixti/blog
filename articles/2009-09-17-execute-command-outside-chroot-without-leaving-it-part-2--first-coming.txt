After I have posted an <a href="/?p=56">idea</a>, the first implementation of it was deployed. And of course it contained a lot of bugs and mistakes. In this post I'll share working implementation, but which still need a little improvement. But first we have to recheck all environment settings, users, groups and so on...

In fact this post will be very short. As I'm not fond of realization. But as it is not very important (at least for me no more) - I don't know if I'll start to write good one or not. So if you want the third part, and don't see it here in my blog - comment out and let me know that you need more nice realization with all this OOP stuff :))

So, let there be the light... As this post was going to be short, I'm not going to write an atom-explaining instructions. Just in few words, to run this daemon you have to:
<ul>
	<li>Run this daemon outside chroot with passing it gateway directory path, e.g.: `<code>chroot-gateway /var/www/fax-gateway</code>` assuming you have called this script chroot-daemon</li>
	<li>Gateway directory should has to be chmoded to 2770, e.g. `<code>chmod 2770 /var/www/fax-gateway</code>`</li>
	<li>Gateway directory's owner has to be user that runs chrooted process, e.g. `<code>www-data</code>`</li>
	<li>User who runs chroot gateway daemon should be within the same group as gateway directory belongs to, e.g `<code>usermod -aG fax-gw asterisk && chown www-data:fax-gw /var/www/fax-gateway</code>`</li>
</ul>

Seems like that's all. So assuming, Apache is ran under www-data user, and daemon should be ran under asterisk user, then the steps to run this daemon should be:
<ol>
	<li><code># groupadd fax-gw</code></li>
	<li><code># usermod -aG fax-gw asterisk</code></li>
	<li><code># mkdir -m 2770 /var/www/fax-gateway</code></li>
	<li><code># chown www-data:fax-gw /var/www/fax-gateway</code></li>
	<li><code># su asterisk</code></li>
	<li><code>$ chroot-gateway /var/www/fax-gateway</code></li>
</ol>

Hope that was clear enough. If not - let me know - I'll explain. And here is daemon by itself. As you'll see This daemon has three command handlers: __do_echo(), __do_faxstat() and __do_faxsend(). If you have read previous posts you should know what this methods are expected to do. If not - go read previous posts, don't be silly - I'm not going repeat all that I have written before. So, hope that was clear enough ;))
