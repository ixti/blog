Every day we hear that _people are social animals_, and that Internet helps
people to get more socialized, and that with with such services as [GitHub][1]
even software development. Bullshit! Internet and technologies _desocialize_
people. I believe that social life is when you talk with people, when you
walk with people, when you have fun with people. Riots are more social acts
than twitting about what you had eat today. I think that there's nothing more
pathetic then "chatting" with 1K of "friends" staying alone in the room. But
this post is about my new tiny app and not about assbooks and so on.

Software development runs very fast and as a programmer I love to stay in touch
what was proposed to what, which changes are upcoming and so on. I got this kind
of wishes when started development of one project with [Node.JS][2], where API
(core and 3rd party modules) changes almost every month. So I really want to
know about "features" of "stable" version of "API" ;))

Another reason was, simply wish to write something in Ruby, after hard day of
coding with JavaScript. And by some reason, I like this notification bubbles.
I really don't understand why...


### What is octobarker

Octobarker is a small application written in Ruby, and [available][3] free under
terms of GNU/GPLv3. It simply fetches given GitHub URL every _N_ minute and
pop ups a notification bubble on every new entry.
