There are lot of articles and tips how to install some packages from .deb files. Most of them are related to usage of `<code>dpkg -i *.deb</code>` some of them are related to using official ISO images. But how to install for example OpenOffice from debs when there are no repositories. After some time I finally found a solution how to install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ooop/">OxygenOffice</a> as it was installed from repositories.

The trick is to use <a href="http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/">AptOnCD</a>. If you don't have it installed yet, you can install it as it is in official repositories:
<pre>
# apt-get install aptoncd
</pre>

In this post I used .deb packages of OxygenOffice. So let's say you have downloaded all necessary .deb files (I used all-in-one tar.gz). Also let's say that all .deb files are stored of OxygenOffice we store in <code>/tmp/oxygenoffice/debs</code>.

Now we need to prepare a CD with packages from that directory with AptOnD. By default, AptOnCD is using <code>/var/cache/apt/archives</code> as packages directory. So you need to tell it where to find your packages with <code>--cache-dir</code> argument:
<pre>
$ aptoncd --cache-dir=/tmp/oxygenoffice/debs
</pre>

Interface of AptOnCD is very intuitive so you'll know what you'll need to do to receive a CD (or DVD) of your packages. Let's say you have stored resulting image as <code>/tmp/aptoncd-20091011-DVD1.iso</code>. Now you need to add it as a source into apt <i>sources.list</i>. And there's where the main trick is :)) First mount it, let's say into <code>/media/cdrom</code>:
<pre>
# mount -o loop /tmp/aptoncd-20091011-DVD1.iso /media/cdrom
</pre>

Now we'll add it to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> but not manually, but with <i>apt-cdrom</i> tool which is default and base utility for CD addition. If you used <i>apt-cdrom</i> you must have noticed that it asks for a CD to mount. But you can avoid it by uisng <code>--no-mount</code> argument. So add your mounted iso with:
<pre>
# apt-cdrom --no-mount --cdrom=/media/cdrom add
</pre>

After this your <i>sources.list</i> will have a line similar to:
<pre>
deb cdrom:[APTonCD for   - i386 (2009-10-11 16:07) DVD1]/ /
</pre>

Now you need to update apt's idex files with:
<pre>
# apt-get update
</pre>

That's all. Now you can install packages from that ISO with <i>apt-get</i> (or <i>aptitude</i> if you like). After you'll finish don't forget to remove line added by <i>apt-cdrom</i> and run <code>apt-get update</code> again.
