Long time I was using WordPress as my blog engine. But most of the time when I
wanted to write something I was to lazy to open up browser, go to admin panel,
click, clack, use ugly semi-HTML, check if everything is OK. Enough! Finally I
have found blog platform ideal for me, and which 100% fulfills my requirements.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, [Toto], from the wonderland of Oz!

So what is so cool about Toto? First of all, it's not a blogging "platform" with
bloated CMS. It's just a small application built right on top of [Rack] with
similar idea to [Scanty]. I guess the best description of this kind of software
was given by author of Scanty, Adam Wiggins:

So what we have under the hood? Well, almost nothing :)) We have clean files and
directories structure, we have easy to extend templates, we have [git] for
keeping revisions history and [markdown] for articles.

Why I'm so impressed? First of all, now I can have local copy of my blog on my
laptop, so I can really start using it as my scratchpad (the main reason I have
started my blog). Second awesome thing, I can do it the way I like, right from
TTY with my lovely [VIM]. Third really important thing is that I can now easily
search through my posts with `grep`. And I can easily see which changes I have
made and when. And I can easily share my blog with anybody, you can clone it on
[github](https://github.com/ixti/blog/) to be able to read my idiocies offline
or use this dummy template :))

There are lots of alternatives with similar ideas, but I love Toto. It's files
hierarchy structure seems more clean to me, and I've just finished almost all
migrations ;))

### What's next?

This is my first post with Toto. There are still lots of things I need to
finish. So next month I will:

* Polish links styles - right now it's pretty hard to distinguish grey links
  from text which is dark-grey
* Migrate all files from old blog into `/public/downloads/`
* Recheck migrated old posts to be valid and readable
* Add categories support
* ~~Add tagging support~~ [https://github.com/ixti/toto/tree/tags]()

### Thanks, my friends

I would like to thank my wife Natalia Zapparova for making my life as it is,
for three wonderful kids, giving me reason to live, not buzzing me while I was
so excited about making my Toto template, and for taking care of me by keeping
my cup full of coffee. Would like to thank [Alexis Sellier][cloudhead] for
making my life much more easier with Toto. Would like to thank [Scott
Stout][skout23] for the migration script (which helped me to make final decision
about moving forward). Would like to thank [Paul Irish], [Divya Manian],
[Shichuan] and all the contributors of [HTML5 Boilerplate]. And all open-source
developers, for making our life better! :))
