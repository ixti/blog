Most of web-browsers allow users to cache form input values. So next time they are going to input a value browser show them suggestions according to previous input for example or auto-filling this for at all. So there are some situations when such approach is not desired. For example such approach is invalid for captcha fields. Or if you're paranoid... :))

The idea is to generate unique input's name every time user see form. So to do this we can simply use md5 hash, or example:
<pre lang="php">
< ?php
$input_name = md5(time());
</pre>

Pretty simple isn't it? But how to know what name we have to look for upon form submit? For this purpose we can use <code>$_SESSION</code> super-global array. So, we can store it with some identifier, like this:
</pre><pre lang="php">
< ?php
$_SESSION['unique_input'] = md5(time());
</pre>

Then we can use this unique name in the form:
</pre><pre lang="html">
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- some head tags here -->
    </head>
    <body>
	<!-- some body tags here -->
        <input type="text" name="<?=$_SESSION['unique_input']?/>" />
	<!-- and here -->
    </body>
</html>
</pre>

So now upon form submit we'll be able to get value of form from <code>$_GET</code> or <code>$_POST</code> super-global array with <code>$_SESSION['unique_input']</code> as key name, e.g.:
<pre lang="php">
< ?php
$value = $_POST[$_SESSION['unique_input']];
</pre>

Yes. Everything is pretty simple. So to demonstrate how it works in real world, I prepared some helper class <code>FormParanoia</code>and demo page which you are free to use :)) Please refer to the sources of this class for API documentation and to the sources of <code>index.php</code> to see how to work with it. Keep in mind this is not a production-aware solution. This is just an idea of implementation :))</pre>
