Some time ago I was really very excited about [Node.JS]. About all that
marketing bullshit about asynchronous (on a single core) execution and so on.
I'm not gonna start another holy-war - let's leave it for rusty (in it's most)
Node.JS community, keenly responsive to any alternative idea, just like holy
inquisition. Instead, a friend of mine (_Hi, MBG!_) and I made some benchmarks
of most interesting things for us, such as working with files, mathematics and
some HTTP servings.

First of all I would like to describe testing environment (my laptop), and some
basics about testing.
