Woo-hoo! Finally I've did it. It really works now. And I have implemented all the things I wanted to have before saying loud about release. Now I can. This release was tested with all: PostgreSQL 8<ins datetime="2011-04-09T11:52:43+00:00">.4</ins>.5, SQLite3 and MySQL 5. All minor bugs were fixed, so I hope those of you who will try it won't get disappointed. So what you'll get by installing this plugin?..

Below you'll find some screenshots and plugin's package. Alternatively you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/ixti/redmine_tags/tree/v.1.1.0">github</a>. If any issues feel free to report them on github - still have no time to set up issue tracking on my new server.

Seems like I have forgot installation instructions but they are dead simple. All you have to do is to install <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on">acts-as-taggable-on</a> gem and then install this plugin. Please refer to the redMine manual about <a href="http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins">plugins installation</a>.

So, what's next? Next, I'm going to extend this plugin to add tags to wiki pages and forum threads, as well as develop it as a core plugin of <a href="https://www.chiliproject.org/">ChiliProject</a>, once <a href="https://www.chiliproject.org/issues/139">the issue</a> will be ready for review. Also I have a plan to make a best (at least in my opinion) plugin for invoices.
