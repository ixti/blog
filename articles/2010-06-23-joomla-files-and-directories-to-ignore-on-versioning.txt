After I was hired for another project of Joomla! based website, I realized that I need a list of files and directories to ignore with the stupid content tracker. I love to keep all changes I made tracked by git. So today, I'm going to list all directories and files that are "optional" - those, which can be removed upon migration and so on...

As I track everything with git, this list is simply <code>.gitignore</code> file. But it's easy to read and understand, so you can adopt it for your needs:
```
/administrator/backups/*
!/administrator/backups/index.html

/administrator/cache/*
!/administrator/cache/index.html

/cache/*
!/cache/index.html

/logs/*
!/logs/index.html

/tmp/*
!/tmp/index.html

/configuration.php
