As I mentioned before in my <a href="http://blog.ixti.ru/archives/16">previous post</a> with respect to <a href="http://astbook.asteriskdocs.org/en/2nd_Edition/asterisk-book-html-chunk/asterisk-CHP-14-SECT-5.html">Call files section</a> of <a href="http://astbook.asteriskdocs.org/en/2nd_Edition/asterisk-book-html-chunk/index.html">Aste­risk(tm): The Future of Telephony</a> 14th chapter, call files have to be moved to the <code>outgoing</code> asterisk's directory. So the process of creating and handling such files if you want an original copy of outgoing call you have to copy it first to the temporary place and then move it to the <code>/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing</code> directory. So process looks like `<code>cp my.call my.call.copy && mv my.call.copy /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing/my.call</code>`. Not so painfull, but not so nicefull :)) So I prepared two healing scripts. Which I distribute under <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">WTFPL License</a> terms :))

Painless call script <code><b>$HOME/bin/call</b></code>:
<pre lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash
# Filename: $HOME/bin/call

TMP=$(date +/tmp/${USER}.%s.call)
OUT=/home/asterisk/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing

[[ ! -f "$1" ]] && echo 'Specify .call file' && exit 1
cp "$1" $TMP && mv $TMP $OUT/$(basename "$1")
</pre>

And it's sister helper - painless new call creator <code><b>$HOME/bin/vimcall</b></code>
<pre lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash
# Filename: $HOME/bin/vimcall

vim "$1" && [[ -f "$1" ]] && call "$1"
</pre>

So, if you have prepared a call file, let's say called <code>dummy.call</code>, you can <i>send</i> it to <code>outgoing</code> by simply `<code>call dummy.call</code>`. If you want to create new call and then after you finish editing immediately call it is as simple as `<code>vimcall new-dummy.call</code>`. Hope this will help somebody.

PS I f it was helpful for you, please, don't be too stingy - leave a comment :))
