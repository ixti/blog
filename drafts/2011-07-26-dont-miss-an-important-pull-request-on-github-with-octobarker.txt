Everybody says that's everything goes socialized, and with such services as
[GitHub] even software development. To be honest, I totally disagree with such
definition of _socializing_. For me _socializing_ is when you talk with people,
walk with people, having fun with people _personally_. Without computers.
Computers are great for communication, I would be fool arguing against it, but
they are not socializing stuff. It's sad to talk with millions while stay alone.
But this post is about my new tiny app and not about assbooks and so on.

I'm really stand against all those strange de-socializing services, but I love to
stay in touch with latest updates on software :)) Not about who and when went to
the toilet, but about who pull requests who and what. In fact for me it's just
some kind of "news" about software right from the front-line. That's why I my
octobarker (formerly called `gh-informer`).

It's a tiny app that will notify you about changes in the feed you will provide
(either your private one or someone's public one) with [libnotify] (Growl-alike
notification for Linux). The usage is really simple:


```
$ ./octobarker https://github.com/ixti.atom
```

By default _octobarker_ will poll feed every 3 minutes. But you may easily
change interval with `--interval=<NUM>` argument, specifying interval in
minutes, e.g. you can ask it poll feed every hour:

```
$ ./octobarker --interval=60 https://github.com/ixti.atom
```

### Requirements

To run it, you'll need Ruby 1.9.x and following gems installed:

* [nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/)
* [libnotify](https://github.com/splattael/libnotify) for Ruby
